Here since many clients can try executing codes for various language in the application . It is difficult to handle or manage concurrent execution. So we can use
1. Worker Threads
2. Queue

Using Worker Threads

Pros:
True Parallelism: Worker threads run in parallel on separate threads, making it ideal for CPU-bound tasks.
Non-blocking: Keeps the main event loop free, allowing it to handle other tasks efficiently.
Scalability: Each task runs in its own isolated environment, reducing the risk of interference between tasks.
Resource Management: Allows setting resource limits and handling complex task logic without blocking.
Cons:
Complexity: Requires managing multiple threads, which can be more complex in terms of synchronization, error handling, and debugging.Overhead: Each thread has its own overhead, and creating many threads can consume significant system resources.

Using a Task Queue

Pros:
Simplicity: Easier to implement and understand compared to worker threads.
Control: Can easily manage the number of concurrent tasks and queue additional tasks if needed.
Resource Management: Limits the number of concurrent executions, preventing overuse of system resources.
Cons:
Single-threaded: All tasks run on the main event loop, which can be a bottleneck for CPU-bound tasks.
Scalability: Not as scalable as worker threads for CPU-bound tasks, since it uses the main thread.
